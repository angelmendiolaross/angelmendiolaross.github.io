Research interests: (sub)urban sociology, housing, race/ethnicity and inequality, policing

My current project examines racial threat in suburban California. Given the suburbanization of poverty, in part due to the gentrification of the urban core, I ask: Does racial threat hold in the suburbs? And are the determinants of police spending similar in the suburbs compared with the coastal urban core?
