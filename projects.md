# Computational Social Science - Projects, Fall 2020

This file provides a short description for each of the projects I contributed to for Part I of UC Berkeley's Computational Social Science class.

## Project 1
My group for Project 1 included Diana and Shruti (both students in the School of Education). We created a single GitHub repo and worked on branches of that repo to edit the same file and add our code in a separate file. I also created my own personal GitHub page: (https://angelmendiolaross.github.io).
